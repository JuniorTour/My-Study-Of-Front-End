<2>DIARY:
    2016年11月16日22:47:19,
    After a long time of planning,I began the project in last night.
    Tonight,I learned the usage of iconfont. Visit http://www.iconfont.cn/plus/home/index to see detail.

    Forget to keep diary.
    The process is ok,did not meet some fatal problem.

    2016年12月8日21:57:11，
    Smoothly!
    Meet some difficulties and work out it finally.

    2016年12月20日21:20:15，
    Busy with building carousel,70% complete.
    Confused with the recycle process of img and the active of index btn.
    
    2017年1月11日20:31:32，
    Go on!

    Q:1.Why the taobao uses a lot of negative margin?And the effect can be achieved through the normal way,such as
    position,float or width/height.

    2017年1月23日20:48:31，
    Think about one thing:the INTEROPERABILITY（互用性）.
    I find that many parts in my js are similar.
    Such as the add "active class" and "close".
    According to my study experience,I should abstract these part to a function that can be interoperated.

    2017年1月26日21:56:23，
    Not a happy new year,but a bit of upset.
    Puzzled by many things...

    I decided to pause this project at now,because
    1.I fell like I cannot learn more new from it.
    2.And I am eager to learn some new,such as the back-end.
    3.I am tired of this "huge" project a bit.

    Then good bye,cheer up!

<3>BUGS:
NOT SOLVED!
    1.ul.right-site-nav>li>.dropdown with absolute position is aligned with content but not what I want
    the border.So there is 1px deviation between <li> and <div>.dropdown.

    A:It is the rule of position and z-index.The z-index declaration will only take effect between sibling element,but not
    parent and son.

NOT SOLVED!
    2.In close.js,
    //close_buttons[i].onclick=close_Itself(target_Id);
    /*The above declaration has a bug,It will take effect immediately,but not after click.*/

    A:I have not learned the Event chapter in Professional JS,so I may figure out it later.

SOLVED!
    3.In  <div class="service-each-links">
    Each line of <a> has some unexpected white space???

    A:Solved by declare display: inline-block; to <a>.I will refer to <CSS definitive guide> to figure it out.

SOLVED!
    4.Mutable variable is accessible from closure.
    currentTab.onclick=function () {
        switchTab(currentTarget);
        /*Mutable variable is accessible from closure.*/
    }

    A:Refer to StackOverflow:
    <1>.Use anonymous wrapper.
    currentTab.onclick=(function () {
        switchTab(currentTarget);
        /*Mutable variable is accessible from closure.*/
    })();
    <2>.Nest two functions.I did not figure out it.
    <3>.Finally I chose the way <DOM programing> taught me.To deliver this pointer to the function.

    7.There will be a 4px white space between the inline-block ele.
    StackOverflow has detailed answer about it,but I finally decided to replace i-b with float.

NOT SOLVED!
    5.The ele.style="display:none;" of close.js and searchTab.js does not work in IE11??

    6.When shrink the page to a degree,the login btn will break because of its parent's width is not enough.
    I do not want to fix it by declare percentage length to login btn.
