"Make sure your web server is capable of serving the document using byte ranges.
 Google Chrome requires that this works. Without it, seeking will be disabled and setting currentTime will have no effect."

It means it is related with the server,I tried another external source,the problem solved.
So I believe it is the answer.

2.The size of icon font should be same,otherwise the outcome will be not beautiful.
